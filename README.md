# Broken Link Checker (AI slop version)

This project is a simple tool to check for broken links in a given website. It crawls the provided URL, extracts all links, and verifies if they are valid and accessible.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd broken-link-checker
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py <url_to_check>
    ```

    Replace `<url_to_check>` with the URL you want to check for broken links.  You may need to create a `main.py` file.

## Purpose

This project was created as a playground for experimenting with building software using AI assistance.
